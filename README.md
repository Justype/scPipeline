# scPipeline

The [scPipeline](https://github.com/NMikolajewicz/scPipeline) analysis pipeline is a modular collection of R markdown scripts that generate [flexdashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard/index.html) reports for scRNAseq analyses, and is dependent on the [scMiko](https://github.com/NMikolajewicz/scMiko) package. The modular framework permits flexible usage, without necessitating complete reliance on a single analysis platform. Additionally, the self-contained reports that are generated by each module provide a comprehensive analysis summary and log of analytic parameters and scripts, thereby ensuring reproducible and shareable analysis workflows. 

To get started with scPipeline, please refer to our [scMiko](https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/) and [scPipeline](https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/) tutorials.
